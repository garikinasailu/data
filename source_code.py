# Number Guessing Game
"""
Title: Number Guessing Game
Description: This game generates a random number between 1 and 100. The player has a maximum of 3 attempts to guess the number correctly. 
After each incorrect guess, the program provides feedback whether the guess is too low or too high. If the player uses all attempts without guessing correctly, the correct number is revealed.
